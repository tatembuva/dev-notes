#### Random

__File Format__, change the line ending of a file that was edited on a windows machine...Really annoying, I should just write a function that does this whenever a file is opened.
``` vim
:set ++ff=dos
```
__Light/Dark__, change the background to light or dark, using the solarized color scheme and it just works, makes it easy to quickly switch the theme...
``` vim
:set background=light
:set background=dark
```
