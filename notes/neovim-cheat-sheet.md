File Format, change the line ending of a file that was edited on a windows machine...Really annoying, I should just write a function that does this whenever a file is opened.
- [ ] auto file formatting on open
``` vim
:set ++ff=dos
```
Light/Dark, change the background to light or dark, using the solarized color scheme and it just works, makes it easy to quickly switch the theme...I go light sometimes üòÖ...
![Theme meme](../images/theme-meme.jpg)
``` vim
:set background=light
:set background=dark
```
- [ ] key binding for theme light/dark toggle
